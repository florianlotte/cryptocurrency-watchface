This Garmin watch face allows you to receive cryptocurrency and stock quotes directly on your watch face! See the images for details.

Currently, this watch face does not support stock indexes; however, you can use an index ETF as an alternative (e.g. use SPY for the S&P 500). I wouldn't use the Dow Jones index, though. It's an inferior index (see more - https://selfaware.blog/home/2017/5/6/benchmark).
